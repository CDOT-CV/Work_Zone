        <alert:Description>Starting in early September, crews on this project will begin making improvements to an 18-mile stretch of Interstate 25 known as &quot;The Gap,&quot; which starts south of Castle Rock and continues to Monument. In addition to building one new lane in each direction of I-25, this project will provide the following benefits:   Safety: Crews will widen shoulders outside and inside the travel lanes for vehicle pull-off and emergency response. This improvement will also help with drainage.  Driver choice: After crews add an Express Lane in each direction of I-25, drivers will have the choice to use the Express Lane for a reliable trip in exchange for a variable toll, or to use one of the two general-purpose lanes for free. Carpoolers (vehicles with three or more people) can ride the Express Lane for free.  Wildlife safety: Crews will construct five new wildlife crossings and install deer fencing.  Improved pavement: Crews will add a new overlay to the existing pavement for a smoother ride.  Improved infrastructure: Crews will repair or replace four bridges, and extend ramps.  Improved truck access: Crews will add truck climbing lanes near Monument Hill and the Greenland exit.  Advanced technology: Crews will modernize communications and power along the corridor to enable advanced technology.</alert:Description>

        <alert:Description>The project will realign US Highway 550 directly into the existing US 160 interchange (at Grandview and Three Springs), eliminating the steep and windy grade of the current US 550 Farmington Hill. The project is focused on linking US 550 to US Highway 160, and is part of long-range planning to enhance transportation for southwest Colorado. The connection is a key component for future growth providing mobility, safety, economic vitality and connectivity for the entire Four Corners area and all communities within this region which continue to experience substantial growth.</alert:Description>

        <alert:Description>The main goal of the project is constructing a new wildlife overpass and underpass. Other safety improvements include an extension of the WB passing lane and an extension of the WB acceleration lane at the US 160/CO 151 intersection. The project's two-mile stretch will also be resurfaced.</alert:Description>

        <alert:Description>Denver Water will be replacing or upgrading infrastructure along Federal Boulevard. As part of this work, Denver Water will replace approximately 180 known or suspected lead service lines from the tap at the water main to the first brass fitting inside the structure. Outreach, coordination and scheduling these replacements with impacted property owners is vital to timely completion, which is imperative due to the tight deadline for upcoming CDOT paving improvements in the area.</alert:Description>

        <alert:Description>Expansion of the roadway where it intersects US 287.  The expansion will include the addition of right and left turn lanes, acceleration lanes, bike lanes, and widening shoulders east and west of the intersection, with realignment of the roadway centerline.  Portions of asphalt and concrete pavement will be will be replaced from 1200 feet west of the intersection to 500 feet east of 109th St.  Additional improvements will take place east of 287/Isabelle intersection at the junction of N. 109th St where the pavement removal and replacement will extend North on 109th St for 300 feet.  The intersection will include a new traffic signal along with improved roadway lighting.  Additionally, roadside ditches will be graded along the length of improvements to ensure proper drainage throughout the project with new storm drainage piping.</alert:Description>

        <alert:Description>The project will realign US Highway 550 directly into the existing US 160 interchange (at Grandview and Three Springs), eliminating the steep and windy grade of the current US 550 Farmington Hill. The project is focused on linking US 550 to US Highway 160, and is part of long-range planning to enhance transportation for southwest Colorado. The connection is a key component for future growth providing mobility, safety, economic vitality and connectivity for the entire Four Corners area and all communities within this region which continue to experience substantial growth.</alert:Description>

        <alert:Description>The project consists of overlaying the existing roadway with 2.5 inches of hot mix asphalt and in places patching degraded areas. In addition, various structures will receive rehabilitation work. This will include bridge railing, guardrail, signing, delineators, and striping. This will improve the roadway function and make it safer for traffic.</alert:Description>

        <alert:Description>The Colorado Department of Transportation will begin work across the western portion of Region 4 to remove and replace the signal head backplates and visors.  Signal backplates are intended to expand the visibility of the signal by providing a consistent and controlled background of the signal. This helps to improve safety of the intersection in which the signal is located.</alert:Description>

        <alert:Description>CDOT will improve South Federal Boulevard from Alameda Avenue to Vassar Avenue by installing raised medians. Work will include removal of pavement, curb and gutter, median installation, signing and striping. This project will provide improved safety to motorists and pedestrians. Raised medians provide refuge islands that allow pedestrians to cross on direction of traffic at a time, wait in the island of the raised median and then cross the other direction of traffic when prompted. The raised medians will reduce car crashes, reduce vehicle speeds and decrease the rate and severity of crashes.</alert:Description>
