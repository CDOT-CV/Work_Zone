Additional iCone data elements:
"sensor" element: A traffic sensor location associated with the
incident
type := The type of the traffic sensor
- "iCone" for an iCone speed barrel
id := A unique identifier string for this sensor location
within the incident (at this time)
latitude := The defined GPS latitude for this sensor location,
if available
longitude := The defined GPS longitude for this sensor
location, if available
"radar" element: Radar details for a sensor element
devID := A unique identifier for the device which reported the
radar data
intervalEnd := The timestamp of the end of the radar data
sampling interval
latitude := The reported GPS latitude associated with this
radar data, if available
longitude := The reported GPS longitude associated with this
radar data, if available
numReads := The number of radar readings made during this data
interval
avgSpeed := The average speed, in mph, for the radar readings
made during this data interval
stDevSpeed := The weighted standard deviation, in mph, of the
speed readings made during this data interval
"display" element: A displayed message location associated with the
incident
type := The type of the messaging device
- "PCMS" for a Portable Changeable Message
Sign trailer
- "AB" for an Arrow Board
- "Signal" for a portable traffic signal
id := A unique identifier string for this display location
within the incident (at this time)
latitude := The defined GPS latitude for this display
location, if available
longitude := The defined GPS longitude for this display
location, if available
"message" element: Message details for a display element
verified := The timestamp that the message was verified as
being displayed
text := The displayed message text. " / " used to separate
lines, and " // " used to separate frames (or pages)
indicator := The meaning of an indication symbol, i.e. "Merge
Right", "Merge Left", "Merge Left or Right", "Caution"
latitude := The reported GPS latitude associated with this
displayed message, if available
longitude := The reported GPS longitude associated with this
displayed message, if available
"marker" element: A marker of a generic location or device within the
incident
type := The type of device used for this marker
- "iPin" for an iPin marker
- "Baton" for a Baton marker
- "Truck Beacon" for a truck mounted beacon
id := A unique identifier string for this marker location
within the incident (at this time)
latitude := The defined GPS latitude for this sensor location,
if available
longitude := The defined GPS longitude for this sensor
location, if available
description := A manual description of the marker.
Frequently, the descriptions will start with a common aspect of the
incident, i.e. "beginning" or "end"
"status" element: Device Status details for a marker, display, or
sensor element
type := The type of status report being made
- "iPin" for an iPin state (Active/Off)
- "Baton" for a Baton state (Active/Off)
- "Truck Beacon" for a Truck Beacon state
(Active/Off)
- "Display Down" for a Display "Down"
verification switch (Down/Up - technically up=NOT verified as down)
- "Display Up" for a Display "Up" verification
switch (Up/Down - technically, down=NOT verified as up)
- "TMA Stowed" for a TMA "Stowed" verification
switch (Stowed/Deployed - technically, deployed=NOT verified as
stowed)
starttime := The timestamp of the first occurance of this
state
verified := The timestamp of the most recent verification of
this state
state := The reported state of this device/marker
