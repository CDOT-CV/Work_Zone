# WZDX Translator

## Project Description

This project is an open source, proof of concept work zone data Exchange . The purpose of this tool is to  build a translator from iCone data to the WZDx message (3.0) and identify additional required data by WZDx that can be populated by other CDOT Work Zone resources.
